  <h4 class= "headings"> Coding a Smart Arcade Game Player!
  </h4>
  <p> This activity exposes students to 1970’s arcade games, letting them enjoy playing those games before asking the students to define <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QTqRpI2CMpyZgtWVlotBhD2zAVA4b41p/view" target="_blank">states </a>for these games. This will expose them to the important mathematical and coding concept of defining real world situations using a limited number of variables that define each state of that real world situation (i.e. in a basketball game the state of the game could be defined by each team’s score). Students also get exposed to basic Python coding concepts that they can use to learn other coding languages. By learning how to code, students will also be learning the basics to logical thinking and algebra. Most importantly, students will be exposed to <a href= "https://www.idtech.com/blog/intro-to-machine-learning-kids-teens" target="_blank"> Machine learning</a>, which is a form of Artificial Intelligence where the computer uses various algorithms to create and improve upon a list of actions using data, neural nets, and state machines. A lot of these concepts are very complex and take time to understand in depth, so we will be focusing on the state machine concept. To do this we will have the students <a href = "https://raisingchildren.net.au/school-age/school-learning/learning-ideas/learning-school-years" target="_blank"> explore their own learning</a> to get them to realize that machines learn similarly to themselves. Through trial and error, machines learn to optimize their behavior, which results in very interesting solutions to a lot of problems!

  <h4 class= "headings"> Seattle MESA - Lock System Alarm </h4>
  <p> For this activity, AVELA members were in charge of 
      designing and preparing the material for afterschool
       programs offered by the Seattle Public Schools. 
       Throughout the course, students initially learned 
       about circuit components which would soon transition 
       into projects. AVELA composed Arduino kits to have sent 
       to students in order for them to have an engaging 
       experience. By applying mathematical concepts as well as 
       basic circuitry techniques, the students were able to work 
       on mini-projects using circuit components like LEDs, distance sensors and
        more to accomplish tasks like ringing a buzzer and making a servo rotate 
    as a timer. The overall Lock System Alarm brought the mini-projects together 
    and the students were able to create their own alarm system.</p>

    <h4 class= "headings"> Mercer Middle School - Tinker aCADemy</h4>
    <p> Throughout the course, students learned about properties of geometric 
        shapes ranging from surface area to volume. The tedious creation of handmade
         models with paper motivated them to use computational tools and learn how to build 3D 
         geometrical shapes with CAD softwares. They designed their own project within given 
         constraints and later used Tinkercad to model what they created.

    <h4 class= "headings"> Mercer Middle School - Coding Fractals!</h4>
    <p> For one hour a week over the course of 8 weeks, students were able to learn about geometric 
        patterns called fractals, like the Sierpinski triangle and fractal tree. Initially, they were
         inspired to learn about beautiful applications of geometric properties that are evident in nature.
        As the course continued, they handcrafted a fractal out of paper and eventually visualized various 
        fractals using an online Python IDE. The students learned how software can be a powerful tool for
        visualizing tedious to handcraft geometric patterns. At the end, the students had the opportunity to
        design their own fractal.

    <h4 class= "headings"> Math Academy 2020 - Fun with sound</h4>
    <p> In a setting where a lot of UW summer programs were canceled, AVELA members created the online activity
         Fun with Sound consisting of programming through Python on Google Colaboratory. Throughout the process, 
         the Math Academy group first created paper airplanes and manually calculated the velocities for some throws. 
         Then, they learned the basics of programming using Python to compute the repetitive math and graph their results.
          Then, they applied trigonometry to create sinusoidal equations to represent the sound waves later used in the main 
          Fun with Sound activity. The students had the opportunity to apply their learning and create their own graphs and songs.

    <h4 class= "headings"> Early Engineering Institute 2019 - Circuit Toss</h4>
    <p>For this activity, the students used Arduino Nanos and SparkFun's BME280 pressure sensors to code a circuit 
        that calculated the approximate altitude of the sensor. In order to allow the campers to throw their circuit as high 
        as they wanted, we 3D printed an encasing for the circuit that fit inside a 3D printed ball we designed. This allowed 
        the campers to throw the ball to whatever height they wanted, then attempt to catch the ball using one of the parachutes 
        we supplied. The purpose of this activity was to show the campers how they could apply the physics’ concepts they were learning in class, 
        coupled with some coding/circuitry tools, to gather real information about the world. </p>

    <h4 class= "headings"> Math Academy 2019 - Circuit Drop</h4>
    <p>This year’s Math Academy group got the chance to do an egg drop activity, with a pinch of electrical engineering sprinkled in.
         Instead of an egg, the students helped to create an impact mitigation device for a very sensitive circuit that measures impact 
         force. The circuit consists of an Arduino Nano for communicating between different components, an accelerometer for measuring 
         the deceleration of the structure's impact, a lithium ion battery to power the device, and a microSD reader to save data to 
         for later calculations. The purpose of this video is to highlight some of the creative thoughts that these bright young 
         engineers put into their designs, as well as to showcase some of their results.

    <h4 class= "headings"> iTech Inclusion Symposium 2019 -  HTML Coding Activity </h4>
    <p>The UW’s iSchool led a day long event for 140 local high school students filled with various workshops. 
        AVELA members taught a 30 minute coding activity to groups of 30 students at a time using the following 
        app: ⁠SoloLearn: Learn to Code⁠Education. During the activity, we guided the students through some basic
         HTML commands that print texts, images, and other graphics to the screen.
