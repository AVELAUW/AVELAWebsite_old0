    <h2 class= "headings"> Mission </h2>
    <p class="para">AVELA members teach K-12 students about college, computing, and engineering through classes, workshops, and other forms of community outreach by representing the populations we aim to support. To teach multi-week classes, AVELA members will first meet with the stakeholders at the school to determine which STEM concepts the students are most interested in learning. Afterwards, our members work to create a lesson plan for a project that is catered towards the specific interests of those students, while also covering the academic concepts required of them in their respective grades through WA state’s Common Core Standards. In addition to creating new projects, AVELA members also help guide CSE and other UW ambassadors through AVELA’s previous projects. This allows more student leaders to work with AVELA’s partnering schools to lead their own multi-week STEM classes. AVELA leadership also networks with local teachers, administrative staff, and industries to build more partnerships and establish strategic planning with those in the Seattle area. </p>

    <h2 class= "headings">Founding </h2>
    <p class="para">In the years leading up to the graduation of the founders of A Vision for Electronic Literacy & Access (AVELA), they helped the University of Washington and the College of Engineering with pre-college outreach and recruitment at the Northwest Earth and Space Sciences summer camp (NESSP), Math Academy, and Early Engineering Institute summer events (EEI). While studying abroad the summer before his graduation, one founder was inspired by the tenacity of students at Sinethemba Secondary School in Philippi, South Africa. Sinethemba student leaders demonstrated a resolve for academic achievement, despite socioeconomic and health barriers, and voiced the issues plaguing their communities which made it so difficult for students to succeed. Connecting particularly well with one of the students at the school who carried with her the spirit of Ubuntu, and out of fear that upon his graduation the workshops he’d helped to host would no longer be offered, the founders came together to officially make AVELA a Registered Student Organization at the University of Washington.</p>
